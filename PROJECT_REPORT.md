# Face Recognition Attendance System - Project Report

## Project Overview

The Face Recognition Attendance System is a web-based application built with Django that automates student attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. The system eliminates the need for traditional manual attendance methods by allowing students to be automatically recognized and marked present using computer vision technology.

## System Architecture

The project follows a standard Django web application architecture with the following components:

### Backend
- **Django Framework**: Powers the web application, handling routing, database operations, and business logic
- **SQLite Database**: Stores student information, attendance records, and system data
- **OpenCV & Face Recognition Libraries**: Provide the computer vision capabilities for detecting and recognizing faces
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Standard web technologies for the user interface
- **Bootstrap 5**: CSS framework for responsive and modern design
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for enhanced UI elements
- **jQuery**: JavaScript library for DOM manipulation and AJAX functionality

   - Timestamps: created_at, updated_at

2. **Attendance Model**
   - Foreign Key: student (relationship to Student model)
   - Fields: date, time, status
   - Meta: Unique constraint on student and date combination

3. **TrainingLog Model**
   - Tracks when face recognition models were trained
   - Stores success/failure status of training

### Core Functionality

1. **Face Detection and Recognition Pipeline**
   - Image capture from webcam
   - Face detection using Haar cascades or HOG method
   - Feature extraction and face encoding
   - Comparison with trained model for identification
   - Confidence scoring to ensure accuracy

2. **Model Training Process**
   - Collection of multiple face samples per student
   - Processing and normalization of face images
   - Generation of face encodings
   - Storage of trained model for future recognition

3. **Attendance Workflow**
   - Face detection and identification
   - Database query to match student
   - Attendance record creation with timestamps
   - Feedback to user on successful attendance marking

### User Interface
